AegisRoute
"Walk smarter, not just faster."

AegisRoute is a premium, smart navigation platform specifically designed to enhance travel confidence for women. By moving beyond the traditional "shortest path" logic, AegisRoute utilizes real-time infrastructure density, business activity zones, and multi-point safety sampling to rank routes based on estimated safety signals.

Features

Smart Multi-Route Selection: Fetches and classifies up to three distinct route alternatives: Safest, Neutral, and Shortest.


Advanced Safety Algorithm: Implements Multi-Point Sampling (checking 3-5 distinct points along a path) to evaluate police proximity, business density (cafes, pharmacies, retail), and hospital access.


LiquidEther Landing Page: A high-impact, interactive shader-based fluid background with GSAP-powered shuffle branding for a premium entry experience.


Crisis Management Module: A dedicated emergency interface featuring one-click WhatsApp/SMS location sharing and direct calling capabilities.

Real-time Infrastructure Visualization: Dynamic map markers for Police Stations (Blue), Hospitals (Red), and Safe Zones (White Flags).

Tech Stack

Frontend: React (TypeScript), Vite, Tailwind CSS.


Animations: Framer Motion, GSAP (LiquidEther & Shuffle components).


Mapping/APIs: Google Maps JavaScript API, Google Directions API, Google Places API.

State Management: React Hooks & Modular Service Architecture.
